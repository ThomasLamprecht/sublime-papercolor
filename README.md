# PaperColor

Port of [PaperColor](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) dark and light variants to Sublime Text theme format.

Really I just wanted to have [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) match my nvim theme and it happens to use that format.

### **Use at your own risk as this is a very naive port at this point.**
